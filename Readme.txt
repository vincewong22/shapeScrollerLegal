Second Deliverable

Our game was functional in the 1st sprint, this sprint we tried to implement
the tutorial, life system, css, responsive page design, and improve game mechanics.

We tried using branches for the first time.  Our team worked on 2 branches.  One branch (functional branch) would move all the
functionality of the 1st sprint into a single page.
    - from comments from our frist sprint we have now:
        - moved all our css into a separate file called css/myStyle
        - our leaderboard also has its own style page
        - we have indented our code
        - we have condensed 4 pages into 1 page
        - our main javascript file js/start.js has been indented with additional comments

The other branch was to include CSS and improve on UI experience (master branch)
    -We upgraded the trash can so you can drag things out of it now.
    -Your allowed to reorder your shapes in each row in case the player drags in the shape in the wrong order.
    -The rows now have snapping.
    -The rows also allow you to swap shapes in-between each other.
    -we cleaned up the logo
    -we made animated buttons
    -we enlarged the radio buttons as commented in our first sprint
    -we have a leaderboard in PHP and SQL live on the web


We were unable to merge both branches together for this sprint. Inside our functional branch, there is still one HTML file
for the tutorial that has not been merged, and the graphical life system.

We have included both branches, the functional branch which does not have the new coding styles yet, and the master branch
which has our improved coding styles and working files deleted.
